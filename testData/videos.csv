The allegations are that these crafts are created at top-secret military bases like Area 51 in Nevada, by reverse engineering alien technology.\n\nIn this presentation, we will look at the evidence that indicates that a secret space programme really does exist. We will touch on the alleged Nazi Bell project and we will mention disclosures by John Maynard, Edgar Fouche. We will discuss the research of Nick Cook and mention William Hamilton - what they found suggests there is indeed a hidden space programme. We will also consider what Gary McKinnon said and ask if things like the Apollo and chemical rocket programmes are simply a distraction that have the effect of discouraging people from considering there might be far, far more advanced Black Programmes in existence and in use.",,FALSE

But what makes maternal healthcare in other affluent countries look so different than the U.S.? Among other things, midwives. Midwives in the U.S. participate in less than 10 percent of births. But in Sweden, Denmark and France, they lead around three quarters of deliveries. In Great Britain, they deliver half of all babies, including all three of Kate Middletonâ€™s. So if the midwifery model works for royal babies, why not our own? Check out the video above to find out how midwives have been at the center of a culture war thatâ€™s deeply rooted in race and class in America.
