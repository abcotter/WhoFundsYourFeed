# WhoFundsYourFeed

### About
The immense quantity of product messaging on social media can make it difficult for users to process and decipher trustworthy content and products. WhoFundsYourFeed is a software solution aiming to help users understand their Youtube consumption as it pertains to sponsored content. Through an interactive, personalized, and shareable report, users are prompted to learn more about the companies and endorsements behind their favorite content creators. WhoFundsYourFeed hopes to increase media literacy and discussion around the way we consume sponsored content online.
WhoFundsYourFeed was developed as a fourth-year Management Engineering capstone design project, and was presented at the 2022 Capstone Design Symposium at the University of Waterloo.
